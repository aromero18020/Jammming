##MusicMatch
MusicMatch is a web application that allows users to find music matches based on their favorite artists. The application is built with React and uses the Spotify Web API to search for music and provide audio previews. The project was built using Vite.js, a fast and efficient build tool for modern web applications.

##Getting Started
To get started with MusicMatch, you can simply visit the deployed version of the app at http://musicmatch.surge.sh/. No installation is necessary.

##Using MusicMatch
To use MusicMatch, simply enter the name of an artist in the search bar and click the search button. MusicMatch will then return a list of similar artists, along with their top tracks and audio previews. You can click on any of the artist names or tracks to view more information on Spotify's website.

##Technical Details
MusicMatch is built with React and Vite.js, and uses the Spotify Web API to search for music and provide audio previews. The application is deployed using Surge, and can be built and run locally by cloning the GitHub repository and running npm install and npm start.
